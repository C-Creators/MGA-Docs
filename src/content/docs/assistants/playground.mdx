## Your Assistant's Interview Room <Badge text="Interactive" variant="tip" size="small" />

The Playground is where you interview and practice with your assistant before they start helping real customers. Think of it as a rehearsal space where you can ask them questions, see how they respond, and make sure they're ready for the job.

## Interviewing Your Assistant

Use the Playground to have a conversation with your assistant, just like a customer would. Ask them questions about your business, try different ways of phrasing things, and see if they give helpful, accurate answers. This helps you understand what they've learned and where they might need more training.

<Aside type="tip" title="Interview Tips">
- Ask the same question different ways – customers won't always use the same words
- Try the real questions you know customers will ask
- If answers aren't quite right, your assistant might need more training materials
- See how they handle casual greetings and small talk too
</Aside>

## Reviewing Past Practice Sessions

The Playground keeps a record of your practice conversations in the sidebar. You can click on any previous session to review how it went, or start a fresh conversation to test from scratch.

## Getting the Most from Practice

Make interviewing your assistant a regular habit. Test them after sharing new training materials, challenge them with tricky questions, and experiment with different settings until you're confident they're ready to meet customers.

## How to Run a Good Practice Session

<Steps>
1. **Be systematic**
   
   Make a list of common customer questions and work through them. Cover all the important topics.

2. **Try to stump them**
   
   Ask unusual or complex questions to find their weak spots before customers do.

3. **Make quick adjustments**
   
   When something's not right, update their training or settings and test again right away.

4. **Keep notes**
   
   Write down any issues you find so you can address them later.
</Steps>

## Starting Fresh

Click **Clear Chat** to begin a new conversation. This is helpful when:

- You want to see how they greet new visitors
- You're testing something specific without past context
- You're starting a whole new practice scenario

<Aside type="tip" title="Pro Tip">
Always start fresh when testing your assistant's greeting or first impression – you want to see what new customers will experience!
