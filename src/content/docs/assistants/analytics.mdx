## Getting Useful Insights

<Steps>
1. **Check in weekly**
   
   Set a regular time to review how your assistant is performing.

2. **Look for patterns**
   
   Notice trends in conversation volume, common topics, and timing.

3. **Spot issues early**
   
   Low engagement or customers leaving quickly may mean something needs attention.

4. **Make improvements**
   
   Use what you learn to add training materials, adjust settings, or refine how your assistant responds.
</Steps>

Use analytics to guide decisions: if many customers ask about a topic, make sure your assistant has great information on it. If conversations are too short, they might need more training.
