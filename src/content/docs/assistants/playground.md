# Bot Playground

The Playground is your interactive testing environment for developing and refining your AI assistant.

## Overview

The Playground provides a real-time chat interface where you can:

- Test conversations with your bot
- See how it responds to different queries
- Debug issues with knowledge retrieval
- Fine-tune system prompts

## Using the Playground

### Starting a Conversation

1. Select a bot from the dropdown (or navigate from the bot's page)
2. Type a message in the input field
3. Press Enter or click Send
4. View the bot's response in real-time (streamed)

### Testing Tips

**Test edge cases:**
- Questions outside your knowledge base
- Ambiguous queries
- Multi-turn conversations
- Different phrasings of the same question

**Check for:**
- Accurate information retrieval
- Appropriate tone and personality
- Proper handling of unknown topics
- Smooth conversation flow

## Debug Mode

Enable debug mode to see:

- Which data sources were retrieved
- Relevance scores for each source
- Token usage for the response
- Processing time

## Resetting Conversations

Click **Clear Chat** to start fresh. This is useful when:

- Testing first-message experiences
- Debugging context issues
- Starting a new test scenario

## Best Practices

1. **Test systematically** - Create a list of common questions to test
2. **Try to break it** - Find edge cases and failure modes
3. **Iterate quickly** - Make prompt changes and retest immediately
4. **Document issues** - Note problems for later fixes
