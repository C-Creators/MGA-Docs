## The Basics: Name & Greeting

Start by giving your assistant a name and writing their greeting message – the first thing customers see when they open the chat. This is your assistant's first impression, so make it welcoming and clear!

<Aside type="tip" title="Name & Greeting Tips">
- Keep the name short and friendly (like "Alex" or "Support Team")
- The greeting should explain what your assistant can help with
- Use a friendly, conversational tone that matches your brand
- Think about your audience – formal for business clients, casual for everyday customers
</Aside>
