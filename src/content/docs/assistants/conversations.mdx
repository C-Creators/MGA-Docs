## Reviewing Your Assistant's Work <Badge text="Live Data" variant="success" size="small" />

The Conversations page is like sitting in on your assistant's interactions with customers. You can read through every chat they've had, see what questions customers are asking, and check if your assistant is doing a good job. Think of it as a performance review for your team member.

## Learning from Real Interactions

<Steps>
1. **Review regularly**
   
   Set aside time each day or week to read through recent conversations.

2. **Spot patterns**
   
   Notice questions that come up often or points where customers seem confused.

3. **Mark issues**
   
   Flag conversations where your assistant struggled – these show where to improve.

4. **Take action**
   
   Update training materials or settings based on what you learn.
</Steps>

<Aside type="note" title="Signs Your Assistant Needs Help">
- **Customer rephrases multiple times** – Your assistant isn't understanding → add clearer training materials
- **"I don't know" responses** – Missing knowledge → add information on that topic
- **Wrong answers** – Check and correct the training materials
- **Happy customers** – Note what's working well so you can do more of it
</Aside>

## Quality Checklist

Use conversations as a quality check for your assistant:

| Check For | What to Look For |
|-----------|-----------------|
| **Accuracy** | Are the answers correct and current? |
| **Friendliness** | Does your assistant sound helpful and on-brand? |
| **Relevance** | Do they stay on topic and address the question? |
| **Completeness** | Are answers thorough enough? |
| **Handoff** | Does escalation to humans work smoothly? |

<Aside type="tip" title="Pro Tip">
Create a **quality scorecard** with these criteria. Rate a sample of conversations each week to track how your assistant improves over time.
