## Teaching Your Assistant New Skills <Badge text="Extensible" variant="note" size="small" />

Plugins are like specialized training courses for your assistant. They add new abilities your assistant couldn't do otherwise – like scheduling appointments, sending emails, or processing payments. Just like sending an employee to a training course, plugins expand what your assistant can do for customers.

</Aside>

## Adding New Skills

<Steps>
1. **Browse available plugins**
   
   Look through the list of skills you can give your assistant.

2. **Read the description**
   
   Understand what the skill does and what access it needs.

3. **Enable the plugin**
   
   Turn it on to make the skill available to your assistant.

4. **Set it up**
   
   Provide any needed information like connection details or preferences.

5. **Test in Playground**
   
   Make sure your assistant uses the new skill correctly before customers try it.
</Steps>

## Setting Up Skills

After enabling a plugin, click settings to configure it. You might need to connect to external services, provide account information, or set rules for when your assistant should use this skill.
