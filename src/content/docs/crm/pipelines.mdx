## What is a Pipeline?

A pipeline is a structured workflow representing your sales process. Each pipeline contains ordered stages that define the journey from initial lead to closed deal.

### Adding Stages

<Steps>
1. **Select a Pipeline**
   
   Click on a pipeline in the left panel to view its stages.

2. **Click New Stage**
   
   Click the **+ New Stage** button above the stages table.
   
   ![Add stage modal](../../../assets/screenshots/crm-pipelines-stage-modal.png)

3. **Enter Stage Name**
   
   Give the stage a clear, action-oriented name (e.g., "Lead", "Qualified", "Proposal").

4. **Save**
   
   Click **OK** to add the stage. New stages are added at the end of the list.
</Steps>

### Reordering Stages

Use the arrow buttons in the **Actions** column to move stages up or down in the sequence:
- **↑ (Up arrow)**: Move stage earlier in the pipeline
- **↓ (Down arrow)**: Move stage later in the pipeline

## Best Practices

<Aside type="tip" title="Pipeline Tips">
- **Keep stages simple** — 4-6 stages typically works best
- **Use clear names** — Stage names should indicate the action or status
- **Order logically** — Stages should flow naturally from start to finish
- **Separate pipelines** — Create different pipelines for distinct sales processes
</Aside>

## Pipeline Examples

| Pipeline | Example Stages | Use Case |
|----------|----------------|----------|
| **Sales** | Lead → Qualified → Proposal → Closed Won | Standard B2B sales |
| **Enterprise** | Discovery → Demo → POC → Contract | High-touch deals |
| **Support** | New → In Progress → Resolved | Support ticket tracking |
| **Onboarding** | Signed → Setup → Training → Active | Customer onboarding |
