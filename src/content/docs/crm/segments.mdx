<Aside type="tip" title="Segment Strategy">
- **Start broad, then refine** - Begin with simple segments and add specificity
- **Use behavior-based segments** for targeting active users
- **Create "at risk" segments** to identify customers who need attention
- **Test before launch** - Preview results to verify rules work as expected
